Are you enthusiastic about classical piano music?

Do you play the piano or are you even a professional pianist?

Do you wish you weren't making music alone anymore?

Welcome to the club KlavierFreude ("PianoJoy") Vienna!

We are a joint initiative of professional and amateur pianists who have set themselves the goal of connecting piano musicians. We meet regularly to get to know each other, chat, exchange ideas and of course play the piano together.

We would also like to offer a platform to organize events and projects together - especially through concerts in informal places, we want to give pianists the opportunity to play, as well as introduce classical music to as wide an audience as possible in a relaxed atmosphere. We are open to your ideas!
