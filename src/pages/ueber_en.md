Are you enthusiastic about classical piano music?

Do you play the piano or are you even a professional pianist?

Do you wish you weren't making music by yourself anymore?

Welcome to the club KlavierFreude ("Joy of Piano") Vienna!

We are a joint initiative of professional and amateur pianists who share the goal of connecting pianists. We meet regularly to get to know each other, chat, exchange ideas and of course play the piano together.

We would also like to offer a platform to organize events and projects together - especially through concerts in informal
 settings, to give pianists of all levels the opportunity to play. Additionally, we want to introduce classical music to as wide an audience as possible in a relaxed atmosphere. We are open to your ideas and input!
