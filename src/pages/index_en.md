## About

You are enthusiastic about classical piano music?

You play the piano, privately or professionally, and you wish you could play more with others?

A warm welcome to the initiative "KlavierFreude Wien" (JoyOfPiano Vienna)! 

We are a group of professional and amateur pianists whose aim is to connect
piano musicians. We meet regularly to get to know each other, chat, and of 
course, to play the piano together. 

In addition we offer a platform to organize events and projects. 
By organizing concerts at unusual, informal locations we want to offer 
our pianists opportunities to perform and also allow everyone interested
to enjoy classical music in a relaxed atmosphere.

As friends of the piano, we want to share "Klavierfreude" (joy of the piano).
We are looking forward to meet you!
